Welcome to my website!

The purpose for my website is provide equal access to CAS UDFs for all Victorian students.

It contains over 80 UDFs for VCE Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics. 

Unfortunately, all these UDFs are for TiNspire, but do not worry if you have a casio classpad, Nhan's site: https://nhtnhanbn.github.io/whitecas/ 
contains many useful UDFs for casio classpad :D

Overall, I hope these UDFs help you in your VCE journey! Enjoy!
