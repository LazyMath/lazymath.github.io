Welcome to my website!

The purpose for my website is provide all Victorians access to CAS UDFs.

I felt compelled to do this after seeing websites selling these types of programs at exorbitant prices of $40-$60, and so 
made over 80 UDFs for VCE Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics to support Victorian students during what is arguably
the most important years of their schooling.

Unfortunately, all these UDFs are for TiNspire, but do not worry if you have a casio classpad, Nhan's site: https://nhtnhanbn.github.io/whitecas/ 
contains many useful UDFs for casio classpad :D

Overall, I hope these UDFs help you in your VCE journey! Enjoy!
